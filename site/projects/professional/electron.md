# cw-eth2-lc


## Description

At Electron Labs, I worked on decentralized blockchain bridges, using Rust to develop performant smart contracts and light client implementations. The project involved integrating advanced cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs within CosmWasm smart contracts to securely verify cross-chain transactions. We also scaled blockchain APIs to support higher throughput while maintaining reliability and security.
