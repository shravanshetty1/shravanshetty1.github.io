## Description

As an early core contributor to Kyverno, a Kubernetes policy management agent, I built foundational features such as the CLI and policy validation modules using Golang. My work helped grow the toolâ€™s adoption substantially. Kyverno leverages Kubernetes controllers for realtime enforcement of security and compliance policies, running within containerized environments orchestrated by Docker.
