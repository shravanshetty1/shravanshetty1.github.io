## Description

Tokenitis is a Rust-based Solana program that enables combining or splitting existing SPL tokens into new tokens. The Solana smart contract was built raw without using Anchor, and the frontend was developed with the Yew framework as a learning experiment. Use cases include NFT packs, gift tokens, index funds, fractional NFTs, and easy token mint setups.
