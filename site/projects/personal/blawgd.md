## Description

Blawgd is a censorship-resistant micro-blogging platform built as a custom blockchain using the Cosmos SDK. The frontend was developed in Rust as an experimental project to explore Rustâ€™s web capabilities. Posts and user interactions are stored immutably on the blockchain, with light clients verifying data integrity using merkle proofs. The platform plans TOR integration for enhanced network resilience.
