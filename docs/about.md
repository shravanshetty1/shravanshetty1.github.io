## Tech Journey

## Beyond The Code

**Gaming:**  
I play games only when theyâ€™re really exceptional. Some of my all-time favorites include *Skyrim*, *World of Warcraft*, and *Path of Exile*. Games fuel my creativity and love for building systems, even if I donâ€™t play often these days.

**Reading:**  
I'm relatively new to reading books but have recently gotten into business books. I enjoy exploring practical ideas that help me grow professionally and personally.

**Note-taking:**  
Obsessed with capturing knowledge, I use Obsidian daily to organize thoughts, project plans, strategies, and insights, constantly iterating on my note-taking system.

## What Motivates Me ðŸ’¡

I love **building things and learning**. Turning ideas into working software and solutions (and getting paid to do it!) drives me. I enjoy tackling challenges, solving real problems, and growing through continuous learning.
