# Project Portfolio ðŸ“‚

Welcome to my project portfolio! Below is a selection of key projects that highlight my skills in rapid prototyping, full-stack development, blockchain engineering, and AI-powered automation.

Personal projects are those I have made for myself while professional projects are those which I have made for a client.

## How I Work

I approach each project with an emphasis on quick iteration, scalable design, and clear documentation to ensure that prototypes can transition smoothly to full production.

You can read detailed case studies by clicking on the project names in the left navigation menu.
